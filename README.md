# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I created this rock paper scissors game as an assignement to help learn html, css, and javascript from the odin project.  This project was focused on utilizing logic using javascript to create the rules of a rock paper scissors game between the computer.  The user determins their pick based off selecting a button and the computer follows up by picking their move based off a random number generator.  Built in logic determines the winner of each round in a contest to get to 5 wins first.

In this project I also focus on DOM manipulation through javascript.  I change the content of the header line to show the overall winner upon completetion of the match and updated the description field after ever selection to show the user the outcome of their pick.

In the futre I would consider coming back to this project to add side panels on both sides that keeps track of selections from both the player and the computer by each round.
